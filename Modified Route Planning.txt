3.  Functional Requirements
    c'. Route Planning (modified)
        i.  Latitude and longitude will be measured in miles. We will consider only a single city, a square 20 miles in length
            centered at (10,10). The user can put a bus station outside these limits but cannot access it.
        i.  To create a travel plan, the user will select two or more bus stations in order from start to destination. For now,
            no selection of city vs long-distance is necessary; city is the only choice. Further, since there is no long-
            distance, we will not worry about refueling right now.
        ii. Each time the user decides to add a new station, there will be a drop-down menu under a search bar. The user can
            type in a substring to restrict the menu, and at any time the user can click the menu to select the correct station.
        iii.If the user pick a bus station outside the city limits, a message will appear telling him that his route goes outside
            the city limits and therefore cannot be generated.
        iv. For now, the system always chooses a city bus, unless only long-distance buses are available. From those, the
            system always chooses the bus with the best gas milage (fuel burn at cruise).
        v.  For each leg of the journey, the system will display something like this:

                    Start: Station Abc
                           Latitude  12.3
                           Longitude 45.6
                    Heading: 15° North of East
                    Time to destination: 0.01 hours
                    Distance to destination: 1 mile
                    Destination: Station Def
                                 Latitude 78.9
                                 Longitude 0.12
