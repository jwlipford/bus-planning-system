# bus-planning-system
A group project for CSCI 240, developed iteratively using the AGILE Method

Group members: Drake Jones, Jeffrey Lipford, Joseph Taylor

#### Project Overview

"The software to be developed is an electronic bus planning system that will be suitable for use in city bus stations. A user should be able to input a starting bus station, a destination bus station, and a type of bus at which point the software will plan a route, including any necessary stops based on the information. The software system is required to have a database of various bus stations and types of bus for use in route planning."
